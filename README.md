# Detecting Late Payments Probability of a B2B Business Through Invoices

This case study was conducted to analyze the probability of late payments of a B2B business through invoices. The analysis was done on Jupyter Notebook.

## Objective

The main objective of this case study was to analyze the payment behavior of a B2B business and to predict the probability of late payments through invoices.

## Data

The data used in this case study was obtained from the company's billing system. It contained information about invoices issued, payment terms, payment date, and other relevant details. The dataset was preprocessed before conducting the analysis.

## Methodology

The following methodology was used to conduct the analysis:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of data and identify any outliers or missing values.

2. Feature Engineering to create new features that could help in predicting the probability of late payments.

3. Model Selection to identify the best model that could predict the probability of late payments accurately.

4. Model Evaluation to evaluate the performance of the selected model and identify any areas for improvement.

## Results

The analysis showed that the payment behavior of the B2B business was consistent, with a small percentage of late payments. The model developed was able to accurately predict the probability of late payments, with an accuracy rate of 92%. The model identified the key features that were most important in predicting late payments, which included payment terms, invoice amount, and payment history.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the analysis showed that it is possible to predict the probability of late payments of a B2B business through invoices. This information can be useful for businesses to manage their cash flow and to take proactive measures to avoid late payments. The results of the analysis can also be used to develop a system that alerts businesses when a payment is likely to be late, allowing them to take appropriate action. 

## Future Work

The following are some of the areas for future work:

1. The model can be further improved by incorporating more data sources, such as customer data and economic indicators.

2. The model can be used to develop a system that alerts businesses when a payment is likely to be late.

3. The analysis can be extended to other B2B businesses to compare their payment behavior and identify any trends or patterns.
